Task 1: Implement Soft Deletes
Goal ðŸ¥…: To add a non-destructive delete feature, allowing documents to be marked as "deleted" and later restored.

Implementation Plan:

Add deleted_at: Optional[datetime.datetime] = None to the VellumBaseModel.

Create a soft_delete(id) method in the repository that sets the deleted_at field to the current time.

Create a restore(id) method that unsets the deleted_at field.

Modify get, find, and find_one to automatically filter out documents where deleted_at is not None.

Add an include_deleted: bool = False parameter to those read methods to allow fetching of deleted documents.

Task 2: High-Performance Bulk Operations
Goal âš¡: To provide a highly efficient way to handle many documents at once, reducing database roundtrips.

Implementation Plan:

Implement bulk_create(items: List[T]) using insert_many.

Implement bulk_update(items: List[T]) using bulk_write.

Implement bulk_delete(ids: List[UUID]).

Task 3: Advanced Type & Feature Support
Goal ðŸŽ¨: To enhance developer experience by seamlessly supporting more data patterns.

Implementation Plan:

Enum & Custom Types: Implement automatic conversion for Python Enums and an API for user-defined types.

Full-Text Search: Add a .search(text: str) repository method and allow text index definition in the model's Settings.

Task 4: Advanced Integrations
Goal ðŸ”—: To integrate Vellum with other systems and advanced MongoDB features.

Implementation Plan:

Transaction Management: Create a transaction() context manager for ACID operations.

Caching Layer: Implement a @cache(ttl=...) decorator for read methods.

Relationship Management: Create a Reference[T] type and fetch_related methods.

Task 5: Production Readiness
Goal ðŸš€: To finalize the library with tooling and documentation.

Implementation Plan:

FastAPI Utilities: Create Depends functions for easy repository injection.

Schema Helpers: Build tools for data migrations (e.g., renaming fields).

Benchmarking & Docs: Create performance tests and write the complete user guide.
