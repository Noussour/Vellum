Implement definition and loading of referenced documents (one-to-one, one-to-many).
Consider lazy vs. eager loading options.
Task 3.3: Schema Evolution / Migration Helpers
Explore and outline a strategy for handling Pydantic model changes (e.g., field renames, type changes) and applying them to existing MongoDB documents. This is a complex area, potentially involving CLI tools or helper functions.
Task 3.4: FastAPI Integration Utilities
Create FastAPI Depends functions for injecting VellumRepository instances.
Provide examples of Vellum usage within FastAPI routes.
Task 3.5: Comprehensive Documentation

This roadmap provides a concrete plan. As you progress, you might discover new opportunities or challenges, so be prepared to adapt!

Before we jump into coding, let's just make sure we're aligned on the foundational knowledge.

What are the common challenges with Pydantic's default type handling when directly interacting with MongoDB's BSON types like Decimal128 or ObjectId for fields other than _id?
What are some of the typical limitations of existing Python MongoDB ODMs regarding their query builder's expressiveness or aggregation pipeline flexibility?
That's an excellent choice! Vellum perfectly encapsulates the precision, durability, and elegance we're aiming for.

Now, let's break down the features to "depasse Beanie" into a clear, actionable roadmap. The key is to identify areas where Vellum can offer more robustness, flexibility, and a smoother developer experience than existing solutions.

Here's a detailed, phased roadmap:

Vellum: Development Roadmap to Surpass Beanie
This roadmap prioritizes features that offer distinct advantages and a clear path for incremental development.

Phase 0: Core Foundation & Basic Interactions (Beanie Parity + Initial Vellum Touches)
Goal: Establish the foundational structure, Pydantic-MongoDB mapping, and essential CRUD operations, with an eye towards Vellum's unique design principles.

0.1 Project Setup & Base Structure:
Initialize GitHub repository your-org/vellum.
Set up core directories (src/vellum/, tests/, docs/).
pyproject.toml with pydantic, motor, pymongo, pytest, pytest-asyncio.
Initial README.md with the Vellum description.
0.2 VellumBaseModel Definition:
Inherit from pydantic.BaseModel.
Mandatory id: UUID = Field(alias="_id") and automatic created_at, updated_at (datetime.now(timezone.utc)).
Inner Settings class for collection_name and initial indexes declaration.
Ensure model_dump(by_alias=True, exclude_unset=True) for efficient MongoDB writes.
0.3 VellumRepository Core CRUD:
Basic __init__(self, model: Type[VellumBaseModel], client: AsyncIOMotorClient, db_name: str).
create(doc: VellumBaseModel) -> VellumBaseModel: Handles _id and timestamps.
get(doc_id: UUID) -> Optional[VellumBaseModel]: Fetches by _id, validates with Pydantic.
find(filter: Dict, skip: int=0, limit: int=0, sort: Optional[List[Tuple[str, int]]]=None) -> List[VellumBaseModel]: Basic querying, Pydantic validation on results.
update(doc_id: UUID, update_data: Union[BaseModel, Dict]) -> Optional[VellumBaseModel]: Handles $set operator, updates updated_at.
delete(doc_id: UUID) -> bool.
count(filter: Dict = {}) -> int.
0.4 Basic Index Management:
Method on VellumRepository to ensure_indexes() based on Settings.indexes.
Graceful handling of existing indexes (no-op if identical, error/warning on conflict).
0.5 Connection Management:
Utility function connect_to_mongodb(uri: str, db_name: str) -> AsyncIOMotorClient.
Basic FastAPI integration example (on_startup, on_shutdown).
0.6 Initial Testing Suite:
Set up pytest with pytest-asyncio.
Docker Compose for a local MongoDB instance for integration tests.
Write basic tests for all implemented CRUD operations.
Phase 1: Vellum's Signature Querying & Aggregation (Major Differentiators)
Goal: Implement Vellum's highly expressive and type-safe query builder (Vellum.Q) and a powerful, type-aware aggregation pipeline that truly surpasses by providing direct Pydantic model outputs for complex projections.

1.1 QueryExpression & Vellum.Q (Comprehensive Operators):
Beyond Beanie: Ensure exhaustive coverage of MongoDB query operators ($eq, $ne, $gt, $gte, $lt, $lte, $in, $nin, $exists, $regex, $type, $size, $all, $elemMatch, $not, $or, $and, $nor).
Implement methods for logical operators (& for $and, | for $or, ~ for $not).
Handle nested field access gracefully (e.g., User.Q.address.city should resolve to {"address.city": ...}).
Integrate Vellum.Q into VellumRepository.find for type-safe filter arguments.
1.2 VellumAggregationPipeline (Type-Safe Output):
Beyond Beanie: The most crucial differentiator:
project(projection_map: Dict[str, Any], output_model: Optional[Type[OutputModelType]] = None) -> AggregationPipeline[OutputModelType]: This method will accept a Pydantic output_model and return a new AggregationPipeline instance with its expected output type updated. The execute() method will then validate against this output_model.
group(group_id: Dict[str, Any], **accumulators: Any, output_model: Optional[Type[OutputModelType]] = None) -> AggregationPipeline[OutputModelType]: Similar to project, allowing direct Pydantic model mapping for grouped results.
Implement core stages: match, sort, limit, skip, unwind.
Ensure methods return self for fluent chaining.
1.3 Advanced Pydantic Type Converters:
Beyond Beanie: Provide built-in, seamless converters for common MongoDB-specific types that Pydantic doesn't natively handle perfectly out-of-the-box (beyond standard UUID for _id):
Decimal128 (from bson.Decimal128 to decimal.Decimal and vice-versa).
Support for ObjectId as a Pydantic field type (e.g., for references) that automatically converts str to ObjectId on write and ObjectId to str on read, without manual @validator boilerplate.
Robust datetime handling (ensuring UTC storage and proper timezone handling).
Phase 2: Advanced Data Lifecycle & MongoDB Features (Robustness & Control)
Goal: Implement robust lifecycle management, optimistic concurrency, soft deletes, and transaction support.

2.1 Comprehensive Asynchronous Lifecycle Hooks:
Beyond Beanie: Implement a flexible decorator-based system for VellumBaseModel methods:
@before_insert, @after_insert
@before_update, @after_update
@before_delete, @after_delete
@on_fetch (for post-load processing).
Ensure hooks can be async functions and allow for modification of the document or cancellation of the operation by raising exceptions.
2.2 Optimistic Concurrency Control (OCC):
Beyond Beanie: A first-class feature. Add an optional version: int = 1 field to VellumBaseModel.
Automate version increment on update and include it in the update query (e.g., {"$inc": {"version": 1}, "version": old_version}).
Define and raise a specific OptimisticLockError exception if the version mismatch occurs.
2.3 Built-in Soft Delete Mechanism:
Introduce an optional deleted_at: Optional[datetime] = None field/mixin.
Implement soft_delete() and restore() methods on VellumRepository (or the model itself).
Modify find, get, count to implicitly filter out soft-deleted documents by default, with an explicit option to include_deleted=True.
2.4 MongoDB Transactions Support:
Beyond Beanie: Provide a simple context manager (with repository.transaction() as session:) for multi-document ACID operations.
Ensure VellumRepository methods can optionally accept a session argument.
Proper error handling for transaction failures.
2.5 More Aggregation Stages:
Continue adding more complex stages to VellumAggregationPipeline: $lookup (with clear guidance on relationship modeling), $facet, $addFields, $set, $replaceRoot, $merge, $out.
Strive for type-hinting support for the shape of data after these stages, if possible.
Phase 3: Ecosystem, Developer Experience & Reach (Polish & Advanced)
Goal: Deepen FastAPI integration, provide tools for schema evolution, and build comprehensive documentation.

3.1 Relationship Management (Optional, but High Value):
Beyond Beanie (potential): Explore different approaches to relationships. Beanie's Link is good, but Vellum could offer:
More flexible fetch_related options (e.g., selective fields, specific filters on related docs).
Lazy loading vs. eager loading with clearer distinctions.
Support for embedded documents (pydantic.BaseModel within VellumBaseModel) and their querying.
3.2 Schema Evolution Utilities:
Beyond Beanie: Provide helper functions or a CLI for common schema migration tasks:
Renaming fields ($rename).
Changing field types ($convert).
Adding default values to new fields.
Potentially a schema_version field to track and assist in data migrations.
3.3 FastAPI Integration Enhancements:
Robust Depends functions for dependency injection of VellumRepository instances, potentially with connection pooling and session management.
Example applications showcasing Vellum with FastAPI.
3.4 Comprehensive Documentation:
Detailed API reference for all classes and methods.
Walkthroughs and tutorials for common use cases (CRUD, complex queries, aggregations, relationships, hooks).
"Vellum vs. Beanie" comparison highlighting Vellum's advantages.
Deployment guides (Docker, production setup).
3.5 Performance Benchmarking:
Set up automated benchmarks to measure Vellum's performance against motor (raw) and Beanie for typical operations.
Identify and optimize hot paths.
